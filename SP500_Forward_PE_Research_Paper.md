## Abstract

This study examines the predictive power of S&P 500 Forward P/E ratios in forecasting future returns and proposes a practical investment strategy based on these findings. Analyzing quarterly data spanning 30 years (1988-2025), we compare five different P/E definitions (Forward I, J(Trailing), K, L, M) and find that the Next 4-Quarter Forward EPS-based P/E (Column M) delivers 63.4% prediction accuracy with 15.31 percentage point outperformance.

Key findings include:
1. Forward P/E demonstrates superior predictive power compared to Trailing P/E (correlation -0.53 vs +0.07)
2. Bottom 25% P/E delivers 15.91% annual returns vs 0.60% for top 25% - a 25x difference
3. **P/E 19-21 identified as critical zone:** Returns collapse beyond this zone (10yr: 20.73%→5.05%, 30yr: 12.59%→1.03%)
4. Current market (P/E 22.72) has fully crossed this critical zone into low-return territory, expecting only 3.6-6.1%
5. Post-2015 low-rate environment has created a "new normal" with P/E elevated by ~1.3 points, yet the 19-21 critical zone remains valid

This research contributes theoretically by challenging traditional mean reversion explanations and practically by establishing concrete P/E-based trading signals with statistical significance.

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Research Background and Motivation

Among equity valuation metrics, the Price-to-Earnings (P/E) ratio is the most widely used indicator. However, practitioners employ various P/E definitions interchangeably, and systematic comparative studies of their predictive power remain scarce.

This research originated from a practical question:

**"Which P/E metric should we use?"**

While seemingly simple, this question encompasses several critical sub-questions:
- Forward P/E (future-based) vs Trailing P/E (historical): which is more useful?
- Multiple Forward P/E definitions exist - which has the strongest predictive power?
- How should we define "high" vs "low" P/E?
- Where does the current market stand historically?

### 1.2 Genesis of Research: Initial Problem Discovery

This research began with a straightforward task: "collect Forward P/E data and create a time series chart." We initially attempted to scrape S&P 500 Forward P/E data from YCharts, but encountered a 5-year data limitation.

As an alternative, we utilized the official data source from S&P Global: [S&P 500 EPS Estimates](https://www.spglobal.com/spdji/en/documents/additional-material/sp-500-eps-est.xlsx).

**Original Data (Provided by S&P Global):**
- **Column I:** Current quarter + Past 3 quarters EPS (Estimates) - NTM-type Forward
- **Column J:** Current quarter + Past 3 quarters EPS (Actuals) - TTM Trailing

However, we recognized that the original data alone could not generate "purely forward-looking" Forward P/E. **Therefore, this research constructed three additional EPS definitions:**

**Columns Constructed in This Research:**
- **Column K:** Current quarter Actuals + Next 3 quarters Estimates
- **Column L:** Current quarter Estimates + Next 3 quarters Estimates
- **Column M:** Next 4 quarters Estimates (completely forward-looking)

Columns K, L, M were generated by recombining quarterly EPS values from the source data, enabling systematic comparison of Forward P/E metrics with varying degrees of "forward-looking" orientation.

This discovery transformed our simple "data visualization task" into a fundamental research question: **"Which metric is actually useful?"**

### 1.3 Research Objectives

This study aims to:

1. **Comparative Analysis:** Quantitatively compare predictive power across five P/E definitions
2. **Mechanism Identification:** Theoretically explain why certain P/E metrics outperform others
3. **Practical Application:** Establish concrete P/E-based trading strategies by quartile
4. **Current Assessment:** Evaluate market valuation as of November 2025

### 1.4 Research Novelty

This study differentiates itself from existing literature through:

1. **Multi-Definition Comparison:** Simultaneous comparison of 5 P/E definitions rather than single metric
2. **Probabilistic Approach:** Calculating actual prediction accuracy (%) and return differentials, beyond simple correlation
3. **New Normal Analysis:** Comparing 30-year vs 10-year baselines to capture low-rate era valuation shifts
4. **Transparent Methodology:** All analysis processes and code disclosed for reproducibility

## 2. Theoretical Background

### 2.1 Traditional Understanding of P/E Ratios

The P/E ratio is the most fundamental metric for measuring relative over/undervaluation. Traditional understanding:

- **High P/E:** Price expensive relative to earnings = Overvalued
- **Low P/E:** Price cheap relative to earnings = Undervalued
- **Mean Reversion:** Overvaluation reverts to mean → low returns; Undervaluation → high returns

### 2.2 Trailing vs Forward P/E Debate

Two P/E definitions coexist in practice:

**Trailing P/E (Historical Basis):**
- Advantages: Objective, verifiable
- Disadvantages: Lagging, misses turning points

**Forward P/E (Forecast Basis):**
- Advantages: Leading, aligns with market's forward-looking nature
- Disadvantages: Subjective, susceptible to forecast errors

Yet systematic validation of "which is actually more useful?" has been lacking.

### 2.3 Research Starting Point

This research began not from existing theory but from **empirical data**:

1. S&P Global's official EPS data contains only I, J definitions
2. To create "purely forward-looking" Forward P/E, we constructed K, L, M
3. Empirically tested which of the five has highest predictive power

**Core Questions:**
- Does traditional "valuation mean reversion" explanation work?
- Or does a different mechanism exist?

The answer is provided in Section 5.2.

## 3. Methodology

### 3.1 Data Collection and Preprocessing

#### 3.1.1 Price Data

- **Source:** Yahoo Finance API (yfinance library)
- **Symbol:** S&P 500 Index (^GSPC)
- **Period:** 1985 - November 2025
- **Frequency:** Daily closing prices

**Price Smoothing:**
To prevent quarter-end single-day spikes/crashes from distorting results, we used 2-week average closing prices (±7 days around quarter-end).

```python
# Calculate ±7 day average price around quarter-end
start_window = quarter_end_date - pd.Timedelta(days=7)
end_window = quarter_end_date + pd.Timedelta(days=7)
avg_price = price_df.loc[mask, 'Close'].mean()
```

This method eliminates single-day volatility while representing quarter-end market levels.

#### 3.1.2 EPS Data

- **Source:** S&P Global - S&P Dow Jones Indices ([sp-500-eps-est.xlsx](https://www.spglobal.com/spdji/en/documents/additional-material/sp-500-eps-est.xlsx))
- **Sheet:** ESTIMATES&PEs
- **Row Range:** 132-278 (expandable for pre-2015 data)

**Original Columns (Provided by S&P Global):**
- Column I: Current quarter + Past 3 quarters EPS (Estimates) - NTM-type Forward
- Column J: Current quarter + Past 3 quarters EPS (Actuals) - TTM Trailing

**Columns Constructed in This Research:**
- Column K: Current quarter Actuals + Next 3 quarters Estimates
- Column L: Current quarter Estimates + Next 3 quarters Estimates
- Column M: Next 4 quarters Estimates (completely forward-looking)

Columns K, L, M were generated by recombining quarterly EPS values from the source data to create varying degrees of forward-looking metrics.

**Data Cleaning:**
Removed extraneous text from date column (e.g., "(81.3%)") and parsed with pd.to_datetime().

```python
date_str = str(date_val).split('(')[0].strip()
date_parsed = pd.to_datetime(date_str)
```

#### 3.1.3 Final Dataset

- **Total Observations:** 148 quarters (1988-12-31 ~ 2025-09-30)
- **Valid Data per EPS Column:** 148 observations (no missing values)

### 3.2 P/E Ratio Calculation

For each quarter $t$, P/E ratio is calculated as:

$$
PE_t = \frac{Price_t}{EPS_t}
$$

Where $Price_t$ is the smoothed average closing price for quarter $t$, and $EPS_t$ is the EPS estimate for that quarter.

### 3.3 Z-Score Normalization

Since absolute P/E levels vary across eras, we normalize using Z-scores to measure relative over/undervaluation:

$$
Z_t = \frac{PE_t - \mu_{PE}}{\sigma_{PE}}
$$

Where:
- $\mu_{PE}$: Mean P/E across entire period
- $\sigma_{PE}$: Standard deviation of P/E across entire period

Z-score > 0 indicates overvaluation, Z-score < 0 indicates undervaluation relative to historical mean.

### 3.4 Forward Returns Calculation

For each quarter $t$, cumulative return $n$ quarters ahead is calculated as:

$$
Return_{t,n} = \frac{Price_{t+n} - Price_t}{Price_t} \times 100\%
$$

We analyze $n = 1, 2, 3, 4$ (corresponding to 3, 6, 9, 12 months forward).

#### 3.4.1 Annualization

To compare returns across different time periods, we perform annualization:

$$
Annualized\_Return = Return_{t,n} \times \frac{4}{n}
$$

Where:
- $Return_{t,n}$: Cumulative return over $n$ quarters (%)
- $\frac{4}{n}$: Annualization multiplier (1 year = 4 quarters)

**Example:**
- 1Q return +4%: Annualized = 4% × (4/1) = **+16% / year**
- 4Q return +16%: Annualized = 16% × (4/4) = **+16% / year**

**Group-Level Annualized Differential:**

We annualize the average return difference between High P/E and Low P/E groups:

$$
Annualized\_Diff = (\overline{Return}_{Low,n} - \overline{Return}_{High,n}) \times \frac{4}{n}
$$

Where:
- $\overline{Return}_{Low,n}$: Average $n$-quarter return for Low P/E group (Z < 0)
- $\overline{Return}_{High,n}$: Average $n$-quarter return for High P/E group (Z > 0)
- High/Low groups classified by Z-score across entire 30 years (148 quarters)

**Significance of This Method:**
- Removes period effect
- Standardizes P/E signal's pure predictive power to annual basis
- Enables fair comparison across different time horizons

### 3.5 Evaluation Metrics

#### 3.5.1 Pearson Correlation

Measures linear relationship between P/E Z-score and future returns:

$$
r = \frac{\sum (Z_i - \bar{Z})(R_i - \bar{R})}{\sqrt{\sum (Z_i - \bar{Z})^2 \sum (R_i - \bar{R})^2}}
$$

Negative correlation implies "high P/E → low returns."

#### 3.5.2 Prediction Accuracy

Using median return as threshold, we dichotomize returns and calculate accuracy:

- High P/E (Z > 0) & Return < Median: Correct prediction
- Low P/E (Z < 0) & Return ≥ Median: Correct prediction

$$
Accuracy = \frac{\text{Number of Correct Predictions}}{\text{Total Predictions}} \times 100\%
$$

#### 3.5.3 Average Return Differential

Most critical metric for investment decisions:

$$
\Delta Return = \overline{Return}_{Z<0} - \overline{Return}_{Z>0}
$$

Calculates average return difference between Low P/E and High P/E groups.

#### 4.1.2 Prediction Accuracy Analysis

**Table 2: P/E-Based Return Prediction Accuracy (Median Threshold)**

| Column | Definition | 1Q | 2Q | 3Q | 4Q | **Avg** | Interpretation |
|--------|-----------|-----|-----|-----|-----|---------|----------------|
| **M** | Next 4Q Est | 56.5% | 62.3% | **63.4%** | 62.5% | **61.2%** | Strong ✅ |
| **K** | Curr Act+Next 3Q | 57.1% | 58.9% | 61.4% | 54.9% | **58.1%** | Moderate |
| **L** | Curr Est+Next 3Q | 57.8% | 59.6% | 59.3% | 55.6% | **58.1%** | Moderate |

| **J** | Curr+Past 3Q (Act) | 48.3% | 50.0% | 51.0% | 52.8% | **50.5%** | Useless ❌ |

**Interpretation:**
- 50% = coin flip level
- **Column M achieves 61-63% accuracy**, statistically significant
- **Column J (Trailing) at 50.5% = no better than random**

#### 4.1.3 Actual Return Differential Analysis (Most Important)

**Table 3: Average 1-Year Returns by P/E Group (High vs Low)**

| Column | Definition | High P/E (Z>0) | Low P/E (Z<0) | **Difference** | Samples (H/L) |
|--------|-----------|----------------|---------------|----------------|---------------|
| **M** | Next 4Q Est | +0.60% | +15.91% | **+15.31%p** ✅ | 56 / 88 |
| **K** | Curr Act+Next 3Q | +3.55% | +13.91% | **+10.36%p** | 55 / 89 |
| **L** | Curr Est+Next 3Q | +4.60% | +14.00% | **+9.39%p** | 62 / 82 |
| **J** | Curr+Past 3Q (Act) | +5.99% | +11.58% | **+5.59%p** | 42 / 102 |
| **I** | Curr+Past 3Q (Est) | +7.69% | +11.57% | **+3.87%p** | 60 / 84 |

**Critical Findings:**
1. **Column M shows 25x return differential** (15.91% vs 0.60%)
2. High P/E periods deliver cash-equivalent returns (0.60%)
3. Low P/E periods deliver strong ~16% annual returns
4. **Even Trailing P/E shows some discrimination (5.59%p), but half of Forward metrics**

#### 4.1.4 Annualized Analysis: Removing Period Effect

**Important Question:** "Isn't 4Q (12 months) having higher absolute returns than 1Q (3 months) simply due to longer time period?"

To verify, we converted to **annualized returns** (30-year data, 148 quarters):

**Table 3-1: Column M (Next 4Q EPS) - Return Differentials by Period & Annualized (30 Years)**

| Period | Low P/E Avg | High P/E Avg | **Difference** | **Annualized Difference** |
|--------|------------|--------------|----------------|--------------------------|
| 1Q (3 months) | +4.12% | +0.04% | +4.07% | **+16.28% / year** |
| 2Q (6 months) | +8.14% | +0.14% | +8.00% | **+16.00% / year** |
| 3Q (9 months) | +12.03% | +0.27% | +11.76% | **+15.68% / year** |
| 4Q (12 months) | +15.91% | +0.60% | +15.31% | **+15.31% / year** |

**Findings:**
- When annualized, all periods show consistent **~15-16% / year** outperformance
- Absolute returns increasing with period = **time effect**
- P/E's true predictive power = **annual 15-16% excess returns**
- This remains constant whether 1Q or 4Q horizon

**Do other P/E definitions also show consistency?**

**Table 3-2: Annualized Excess Returns Comparison Across 5 P/E Definitions (30 Years, 148 Quarters)**

| EPS Definition | 1Q→Ann | 2Q→Ann | 3Q→Ann | 4Q→Ann | **Average** | Consistency |
|---------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|-------------|-------------|
| **M (Next 4Q)** | +16.29% | +16.00% | +15.68% | +15.31% | **+15.82%** | ✅ Highly Consistent |
| K (Curr Act+Next 3Q) | +15.48% | +13.43% | +13.11% | +10.36% | **+13.09%** | △ Variable |
| L (Curr Est+Next 3Q) | +14.33% | +12.38% | +11.08% | +9.39% | **+11.80%** | △ Variable |
| J (Trailing) | +3.88% | +3.63% | +3.97% | +5.59% | **+4.27%** | ⚪ Low but Stable |
| I (Curr+Past 3Q) | +1.15% | +1.53% | +3.35% | +3.87% | **+2.47%** | ❌ Nearly Useless |

**Additional Findings:**

1. **Only Column M shows perfect consistency:**
   - 15.31% ~ 16.29% (range: 0.98pp)
   - Average 15.82%/year, highest

2. **K, L have good averages but vary:**
   - K: 10.36% ~ 15.48% (range: 5.12pp)
   - L: 9.39% ~ 14.33% (range: 4.94pp)
   - Predictive power varies by period

3. **Trailing (J) is low but consistent:**
   - 3.63% ~ 5.59% (range: 1.96pp)
   - Average 4.27%/year, low

4. **I is completely useless:**
   - Average 2.47%/year (1/6 of M)

**Conclusion:**
- **Column M not only has highest predictive power but also most stable**
- K, L are decent (11-13%/year) but period-dependent
- **Reason to use M: High predictive power + Consistency**

**Practical Implications:**
- P/E signal shows consistent effect from short-term (1Q) to long-term (4Q) for Column M
- However, accuracy is highest at 2-3Q forward (correlation -0.54 ~ -0.59)

### 4.2 Understanding Correlation: -0.59 ≠ 59% Probability

During initial research, a question arose: "Does correlation -0.59 mean 59% prediction probability?"

**This is a misinterpretation.**

#### 4.2.1 Relationship Between Correlation and Predictive Power

- **Correlation (r):** Strength and direction of linear relationship (-1 to +1)
- **Coefficient of Determination (R²):** r² = 0.59² = 0.35, meaning P/E explains 35% of return variance
- **Prediction Accuracy:** Actually 61-63%

#### 4.2.2 The 92% Trap: Market Upward Bias

Initial analysis yielded "92% probability of positive returns when P/E is low," which proved misleading:

**Flawed Analysis (Actual Results, Column M 4Q):**
- Low P/E (Z<0): Positive returns = 81/88 = **92%**
- High P/E (Z>0): Positive returns = 49/56 = **88%**
- Difference: Only **4 percentage points**

**Problem:** 
- S&P 500 rose in approximately **130/144 = 90% of quarters** over 30 years
- Thus 92% reflects **market's inherent upward bias**, not P/E's predictive power
- Most periods show positive returns regardless of P/E, making this metric meaningless

**Correct Analysis: Using Median Return as Threshold**

The median 1-year return across 144 quarters is **+11.33%**. Using this to distinguish "good/poor returns" and recalculating:

- Low P/E (Z<0): Returns above median (11.33%) = 53/88 = **60.2%**
- High P/E (Z>0): Returns above median = 19/56 = **33.9%**
- Difference: **26.3 percentage points** (now a clear distinction!)

Now P/E's true predictive power emerges.

#### 4.2.3 Going Further: Magnitude Matters

Beyond simple "above/below median," **actual return magnitudes** matter most:

- High P/E: Average +0.60%
- Low P/E: Average +15.91%

This is the truly actionable information for investors.

## 5. Deep Analysis: Why Does Forward P/E Work?

### 5.1 Traditional Explanation: Valuation Mean Reversion

Traditionally explained as "high P/E reverts to mean, thus lower returns."

However, this explanation has a problem:
- **If truly mean reversion, Trailing P/E should also work**
- But Trailing P/E has zero predictive power (r = +0.07)

### 5.2 Our Explanation: Consensus Forecast Realization

**Forward P/E's negative correlation is not true "mean reversion" but "consensus EPS forecast realization."**

#### 5.2.1 Mechanism

1. Forward P/E incorporates analyst EPS forecasts
2. High P/E = Price high relative to expected EPS = growth expectations already priced in
3. 3-4 quarters later, when forecasts materialize, prices adjust or stagnate
4. Thus lower returns result

**Evidence:**
- Trailing P/E (past EPS): No predictive power
- Forward P/E (includes future EPS forecasts): Strong predictive power

**Difference = Informational value of analyst forecasts**

#### 5.2.2 Why Column M Strongest?

**Table 4: EPS Column Definitions**

| Column | Definition | Source | Future Component |
|--------|-----------|--------|------------------|
| I | Current + Past 3Q (Estimates) | S&P Global | Some (Current Q est) |
| J | Current + Past 3Q (Actuals) | S&P Global | **None** |
| K | Current Actuals + Next 3Q Estimates | **This Research** | Next 3Q |
| L | Current Estimates + Next 3Q Estimates | **This Research** | Current Q + Next 3Q |
| M | Next 4Q Estimates | **This Research** | **Entirely Future** |

Column M is **purely forward-looking**, thus:
- Best alignment with market's forward-looking nature
- Strongest reflection of analyst consensus
- Highest predictive power

### 5.3 Asymmetric Prediction Accuracy

**Table 5: Column M Prediction Accuracy Comparison (3Q, Median 11.33% Threshold)**

| P/E State | Correct Prediction | Accuracy |
|-----------|-------------------|----------|
| High P/E (Z>0) | Below-median returns occur | 38/57 = **66.7%** |
| Low P/E (Z<0) | Above-median returns occur | 54/88 = **61.4%** |

**Finding:** Accuracy is higher when P/E is high (66.7% vs 61.4%)

**Interpretation:**
- High P/E → Predicts "below-average returns" with 66.7% probability
- Low P/E → Predicts "above-average returns" with 61.4% probability
- Difference exists, but both exceed 60% (meaningful level)

**Practical Implications:**
- High P/E periods' risks are more clearly identified
- "When NOT to buy" signal is more reliable

| 90th percentile | 24.35 | 22.81 | -1.54 | -6.3% |

**Evidence of "New Normal":**

1. **Undervaluation Threshold Risen:** 25th percentile increased from 15.0 → 17.8 (~3 points)
2. **Mean Elevated:** Overall ~1.3-1.5 point increase
3. **Ceiling Compressed:** Extreme overvaluation threshold actually declined

**Causes:**
- Post-2015 low interest rate environment
- Quantitative easing policies
- Long-term bond yields declining → equity discount rates falling → P/E rising

### 6.2 Average Returns by Quartile

#### 6.2.1 30-Year Baseline

**Table 8: Average 1-Year Returns by P/E Quartile (30 Years)**

| Range | P/E Level | Avg Return | Samples | Percentile |
|-------|-----------|-----------|---------|------------|
| Extreme Under | < 13.4 | **+19.45%** | 15 | Bottom 10% |
| Strong Under | 13.4 - 15.0 | +12.78% | 22 | 10-25% |
| Slight Under | 15.0 - 17.5 | +16.05% | 37 | 25-50% |
| Slight Over | 17.5 - 21.1 | +12.59% | 36 | 50-75% |
| Strong Over | 21.1 - 24.3 | +1.03% | 19 | 75-90% |
| Extreme Over | ≥ 24.3 | **-13.75%** | 15 | Top 10% |

**Spread:** Lowest vs Highest = **33.2 percentage points**

#### 6.2.2 10-Year Baseline (More Relevant)

**Table 9: Average 1-Year Returns by P/E Quartile (10 Years)**

| Range | P/E Level | Avg Return | Samples | Percentile |
|-------|-----------|-----------|---------|------------|
| Extreme Under | < 17.3 | **+27.61%** | 4 | Bottom 10% |
| Strong Under | 17.3 - 17.8 | +16.40% | 6 | 10-25% |
| Slight Under | 17.8 - 19.0 | +20.73% | 10 | 25-50% |
| Slight Over | 19.0 - 21.7 | +5.05% | 8 | 50-75% |
| Strong Over | 21.7 - 22.8 | +6.09% | 4 | 75-90% |
| Extreme Over | ≥ 22.8 | **+3.55%** | 4 | Top 10% |

**Note:** 10-year sample has limited observations (n < 10) in some ranges, constraining statistical power

### 6.3 Critical Discovery: P/E 19-21 as the Critical Zone

**Important Finding:**

Both 30-year and 10-year data show **sharp return decline starting around P/E 19-21**:

**10-Year Basis (More Clear):**
- P/E 17.8-19.0 (25-50 percentile): **+20.73%** (Strong Returns)
- **P/E 19.0-21.7 (50-75 percentile): +5.05%** ⚠️ (Decline Begins!)
- P/E 21.7-22.8 (75-90 percentile): +6.09% (Low Returns Persist)
- **Return Change: 20.73% → 5.05% = -15.68pp Sharp Drop**

**30-Year Basis:**
- P/E 17.5-21.1 (50-75 percentile): +12.59% (Decent)
- **P/E 21.1-24.3 (75-90 percentile): +1.03%** ⚠️ (Extreme Drop!)
- **Return Change: 12.59% → 1.03% = -11.56pp Decline**

**Critical Zone:**

**P/E 19-21 zone is the "return collapse starting point":**
- **Below 19:** Good returns (12-20%)
- **19-21:** Return decline begins (5-13%)
- **Above 21:** Low returns locked in (1-6%)
- **Current P/E 22.72 has completely crossed into low return zone**

**Significance of This Discovery:**
1. **Absolute critical zone identified:** Not just relative evaluation but concrete numbers (19-21)
2. **Robust pattern:** Appears consistently across both 30-year and 10-year data
3. **Current market assessment:** P/E 22.72 clearly beyond critical zone = danger
4. **Practical timing tool:** Provides concrete action guideline: "Wait for P/E < 19"

### 6.3.1 Why Only Column M Shows Clear 19-21 Critical Zone?

We validated whether other P/E definitions (I, K, L) also exhibit the same critical zone:

**Table 11: 10-Year Basis - Quartile Return Comparison Across 4 P/E Definitions**

| EPS Definition | Bottom 25% | 25-50% | 50-75% | Top 25% | Spread |
|---------------|-----------|--------|--------|---------|--------|
| **M (Next 4Q)** | +20.89% | +20.73% | **+5.05%** | +4.82% | **+16.07%p** 🏆 |
| L (Curr Est+Next 3Q) | +11.32% | +18.57% | +18.07% | +4.79% | +6.53%p |
| K (Curr Act+Next 3Q) | +10.11% | +19.79% | +18.07% | +4.79% | +5.32%p |
| I (Curr+Past 3Q) | +15.86% | +17.77% | +3.27% | **+18.48%** | **-2.62%p** ❌ |

**Key Findings:**

1. **Only Column M shows sharp decline in 50-75% range:**
   - M: 20.73% → **5.05%** (50-75% range)
   - K, L: Maintain 18-19% (50-75% range)
   - K, L only decline beyond 75%

2. **Column I shows paradoxical results:**
   - Top 25% actually delivers +18.48% (high!)
   - Spread -2.62% (negative)
   - **Confirms complete lack of predictive power**

3. **Critical zone differences:**
   - **M: P/E 19-21** (50-75% = 75th percentile)
   - **K, L: P/E 22-24** (75-100% = above 75th percentile)
   - **~2-3 point difference**

4. **Why is M clearest?**
   - M is **purely forward-looking (Next 4Q)**
   - K, L include current quarter → mixed with lagging component
   - I includes past 3 quarters → nearly meaningless

**Practical Implications:**
- **"Buy below 19" rule applies ONLY to Column M**
- If using K or L, critical threshold should be adjusted to ~22
- M provides clearest timing signals

### 6.4 Practical Investment Strategy

#### 6.4.1 Signal Framework (10-Year New Normal Basis)

**Table 10: Trading Signals Based on Forward P/E (M)**

| P/E Range | Signal | Allocation | Expected 1Y Return | Action |
|-----------|--------|-----------|-------------------|--------|
| **< 17.3** | 🟢 Strong Buy | 120%+ | +27.61% | Leveraged Long |
| **17.3 - 17.8** | 🟢 Buy | 100% | +16.40% | Full Position |
| **17.8 - 19.0** | 🟡 Overweight | 80% | +20.73% | Add Exposure |
| **19.0 - 21.7** | 🟡 Neutral | 50-60% | +5.05% | Hold |
| **21.7 - 22.8** | 🔴 Underweight | 30-40% | +6.09% | Reduce |
| **≥ 22.8** | 🚨 Strong Sell | 0-20% | +3.55% | Minimal |

#### 6.4.2 Current Market Assessment (As of September 30, 2025)

**Current Forward P/E (M): 22.72**

- **Classification:** 🔴 Strong Overvaluation (75-90th percentile)
- **Signal:** Between Underweight and Strong Sell
- **Expected Return:** +3.6% to +6.1%
- **Recommended Allocation:** 20-40%

**Risk Analysis:**
- Current P/E approaches extreme overvaluation threshold (22.8)
- Top 25% historically on 10-year basis
- If P/E reverts to median (18.97), implies **-16.5% price decline** (holding EPS constant)

**Opportunity Analysis:**
- Attractive entry point: P/E < 17.8 (currently 22% decline needed)
- Extreme undervaluation (<17.3) historically yields +27.6% average returns

## 7. Research Limitations and Future Directions

### 7.1 Data Limitations

#### 7.1.1 Sample Size

- 30 years = 148 quarters, 10 years = 40 quarters
- Some ranges (extremes) have n < 10, limiting statistical power
- Particularly 10-year data's extreme ranges have only n = 4-6 observations

#### 7.1.2 Survivorship Bias

- S&P 500 composition changes over time
- Failed companies exit, potentially overstating returns
- However, impact limited as P/E signals are relative comparisons

### 7.2 Model Limitations

#### 7.2.1 Prediction Accuracy Bounds

- 61-63% accuracy means 37-39% error rate
- Individual timing still highly uncertain
- Not an absolute timing tool

#### 7.2.2 Black Swan Events

- 2008 Financial Crisis, 2020 COVID-19: extreme events unpredictable by model
- During such periods, P/E may become meaningless (EPS collapses)

#### 7.2.3 Structural Changes

- Future may differ from past
- AI revolution, rate normalization could alter P/E structure
- "This time is different" is dangerous, but possible

### 7.3 Future Research Directions

#### 7.3.1 Sector-Level Analysis

- P/E predictive power may vary by sector
- Tech vs Financials vs Energy, etc.

#### 7.3.2 Macro Variable Integration

- Incorporate interest rates, inflation, GDP growth
- Conditional P/E models: "Does P/E meaning change with high rates?"

#### 7.3.3 Time-Varying Correlations

- Does P/E predictive power differ in bull vs bear markets?
- Apply regime-switching models

#### 7.3.4 Options Strategies

- Apply P/E signals to options strategies
- High P/E → Call Selling, Low P/E → Put Selling

#### 7.3.5 International Comparison

- Does framework apply to Korea, Japan, European markets?
- What about emerging markets?

## 8. Conclusion

### 8.1 Research Summary

This study compared five S&P 500 P/E definitions and discovered:

1. **Forward P/E (Column M) superior:** 63.4% prediction accuracy, 15.31%p outperformance
2. **Trailing P/E useless:** 50.5% accuracy = random
3. **P/E 19-21 as critical zone:** Returns collapse beyond this zone (10yr: 20.73%→5.05%, 30yr: 12.59%→1.03%)
4. **Current market in danger zone:** P/E 22.72 has fully crossed the critical zone, expected returns only 3.6-6.1%
5. **New normal exists but critical zone remains:** Post-2015 P/E baseline elevated ~1.3 points, yet 19-21 critical zone still valid

### 8.2 Theoretical Contributions

#### 8.2.1 Limits of Efficient Market Hypothesis

If markets were fully efficient, P/E should not predict future returns. Our results suggest markets fail **semi-strong form efficiency**.

However, rather than "market inefficiency," this may reflect **behavioral factors and gradual information incorporation:**
- Investors chase momentum despite knowing valuations
- Analyst forecasts adjust gradually
- Market prices alternate between over- and under-reaction

#### 8.2.2 New Perspective on Mean Reversion

This study reinterprets traditional "P/E mean reversion" explanations:

**Traditional Explanation:**
- "High P/E means valuations themselves revert to historical mean, thus lower returns"
- If this were true, Trailing P/E (historical earnings) should also have predictive power

**Our Findings:**
- Trailing P/E: correlation +0.07 (no predictive power)
- Forward P/E: correlation -0.53 (strong predictive power)
- **Difference = informational value of future EPS forecasts**

**Reinterpretation:**
- Forward P/E's negative correlation is not "P/E mean reversion" but rather
- **"Price re-adjusting to align with Forward EPS consensus"**
- Analysts forecast 3-4Q ahead EPS → Current high P/E = growth already priced in
- When forecasts materialize 3-4Q later, no further upside → low returns

**Evidence:**
- If truly mean reversion: Trailing P/E should work too → Actually doesn't work
- Only Forward P/E works = future forecast component is key → supports consensus realization mechanism

### 8.3 Practical Implications

#### 8.3.1 Investment Strategy Guide

**Core Principle: Utilizing P/E 19-21 Critical Zone**

This research's most practical finding is that **P/E 19-21 is the return collapse zone**. Strategy based on this:

**Aggressive Buy (P/E < 17.8):**
- Historical avg return: 16-27%
- Percentile: Bottom 25%
- Action: Full position or leverage

**Cautious Buy (17.8 ≤ P/E < 19):**
- Historical avg return: 16-20%
- Percentile: 25-50%
- Action: Add exposure, dollar-cost average
- **Complete positioning before reaching 19**

**Caution Zone (19 ≤ P/E < 21):**
- Historical avg return: 5-13% (sharp decline)
- Percentile: 50-75%
- Action: Hold neutral, stop new buying
- **Critical zone entered, no position increase**

**Danger Zone (P/E ≥ 21):**
- Historical avg return: 1-6% (low returns)
- Percentile: 75%+
- Action: Reduce exposure, build cash
- **Current market (22.72) is here**

**Timing Considerations:**
- Highest accuracy at 2-3Q (6-9 month) forward
- Unsuitable for short-term (1-month) timing
- Use for medium-term strategic allocation adjustments

#### 8.3.2 Current Application (November 2025)

**Current Situation:**
- Forward P/E (M): 22.72
- Assessment: Low return zone (above 21)
- Above critical zone (19-21): +1.7p ~ +3.7p higher

**Recommended Actions:**
1. **Defer new purchases:** Wait for P/E < 19
2. **Increase cash:** Maintain 30-50% cash
3. **Target entry:** P/E < 19 (requires ~16% decline from current)
4. **Extreme opportunity:** P/E < 17.8 (requires ~22% decline)

### 8.4 Final Conclusions

**"Which P/E should we use?"**

Answer: **Forward P/E (Next 4Q EPS based)**

**"How is current market?"**

Answer: **Strong overvaluation zone, caution required**

**"When to buy?"**

Answer: **Wait for P/E < 17.8**

This research does not claim to offer a perfect crystal ball for complex markets. Rather, it provides **statistically significant edge: 61-63% accuracy and 15%p outperformance.**

Investing is a probabilistic game. Tilting probabilities even slightly in your favor - that is this research's value.

### Key Code Examples

**1. P/E Calculation and Z-Score Normalization:**

```python
# Calculate P/E
quarterly_df['PE'] = quarterly_df['Price'] / quarterly_df['EPS']

# Z-Score normalization
mean_pe = quarterly_df['PE'].mean()

```

**2. Forward Returns Calculation:**

```python
# Calculate 1Q, 2Q, 3Q, 4Q forward returns
for n_quarters in [1, 2, 3, 4]:
    quarterly_df[f'Return_{n_quarters}Q'] = \
        quarterly_df['Price'].pct_change(n_quarters).shift(-n_quarters) * 100
```

**3. Correlation and Accuracy Calculation:**

```python
# Pearson correlation
correlation = zscore.corr(returns)

# Accuracy using median threshold
median_return = returns.median()
high_pe_correct = ((zscore > 0) & (returns < median_return)).sum()
low_pe_correct = ((zscore < 0) & (returns >= median_return)).sum()
accuracy = (high_pe_correct + low_pe_correct) / len(zscore) * 100
```
